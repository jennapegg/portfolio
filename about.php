        <p>I am an archaeology student turned web developer ready to take all of the skills learned from both career paths to my next adventure: a full time web development position. I have completed the Web Development Diploma program at RED Academy, and through this have an excellent understanding of JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, CSS/SCSS, HTML, and more. I bring to a team a positive outlook and work ethic, and an ability to work efficiently both in a group setting and autonomously. </p>
        <p>Through the two seemingly opposite passions of archaeology and Web Development, I have learned the importance of attention to detail, having a methodical and focused work ethic, and understanding the wants and needs of both ancient peoples and clients and designers. Iâ€™m excited to take my knowledge of the past and bring it into my future. </p>
        <p>While much of my past experience has been in customer service, I take with me all of the important skills from that line of work. Mainly excellent people skills, a positive demeanor, and the knowledge that for a company or store to excel, all of the moving parts must work together efficiently and professionally, from CEO to Customer Service Representatives.</p>
        <p>I am now looking for a new adventure in Web Development, and bring to the forefront an excellent understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and more. Through my recent schooling in Web Development, I understand the importance of both group work and autonomy.</p>
